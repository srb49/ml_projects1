# ML Projects - Supervised Learning Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of several **supervised machine learning algorithms** for learning, experimentation, and demonstration purposes.  
It is intended for beginners and intermediate learners who want to understand how these algorithms work from scratch.

## Algorithms Implemented
- **Decision Tree**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Na√Øve Bayes**
